Mod for game Medal of Honor: Allied Assault

I'm making a mod for Medal of Honor because I want to improve this game with HD models, high definition textures, new maps and best animation. All for enjoy as a new game this famous and important game because It was one of the firsts and best 2WW games about a sequel that was born in PlayStation by hand of Steven Spilberg.
